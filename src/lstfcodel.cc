/* Christen - Notes on 'Slack' time.
 * Slack time is actually defined as the amount of delay a
 * packet can tolerate from source host to destination host.
 * It is supposed to be allocated at the packet level, 
 * however, NS does not easily allow me to do this, and I 
 * cannot figure out how without getting SEGFAULT's from 
 * modifying the packet's header. 
 *
 * The easier solution with this was to have the queue 
 * implement the slack time feature. In this way, the queue
 * `should` try to minimize slack time, however that is a
 * work-in-progress.
